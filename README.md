### Hi there 👋

<!--
**syenpark/syenpark** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

- **🔭 I’m currently working on** production-grade AI/ML systems for real-time analytics, and designing scalable architectures that don’t fall over at scale.
- **🌱 I’m currently learning** low-latency engineering fundamentals (C++, data structures, perf profiling).
- **👯 I’m looking to collaborate on** real-world ML systems (not toy notebooks): video analytics, streaming pipelines, inference optimization, or knowledge-graph–driven AI.
- **🤔 I’m looking for help with** scaling multi-GPU inference, ultra-low-latency system design, and C++ performance patterns.
- **💬 Ask me about** DeepStream vs Python tradeoffs, GPU/CPU bottlenecks, scaling multi-camera analytics, or why “just use an LLM” usually breaks in production.
- **📫 How to reach me**: via email.
- **😄 Pronouns**: she/her.
- **⚡ Fun fact**: Wannabe Super Nanny – balancing real-time analytics, system engineering, and baby bottle schedules 🍼 + 💻.
